  LTUX is a FREE annual campus-wide expo at Lawrence Technological University that combines anime, games, and Esports to showcase local talent in the form of local game showcases, cosplay competitions, gaming tournaments, talks, panels, and more!

  Advised by faculty members Dr. Stephen Mallory, Dr. Ahu Yolac, and Professor Jose Gonzalez-Belmonte, student leaders pool their resources together each year to provide a free celebration of everything LTU and Michigan has to offer. Great work, a friendly and welcoming studio culture, and amazing potential.
