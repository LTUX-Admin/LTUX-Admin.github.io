description: Spencer Baughman is a Narrative Designer, Composer, 2D Artist and Founder
  of Attempting Entertainment. He has been mentored under Elaine Gomez, Senior Game
  Designer at E-Line Media on the nature of narrative design which led to giving a
  peer reviewed talk on the topic at the Great Lakes Game Expo. Aware of the industry's
  notorious labor problem, Spencer also founded the Detroit Chapter of Game Workers
  Unite, an organization dedicated to help unionize the largely unregulated field
  which itself led to being interviewed by Bloomberg about the experience. He currently
  is a QA tester for the Quantum Astrophysicists Guild and graduates Lawrence Technological
  University the fall semester of 2021 with the goal of pursuing his masters degree
  soon thereafter.
