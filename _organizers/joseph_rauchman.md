description: Joe is an Alumni from LTU with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Management. Joe helped coordinate earlier iterations of LTUX between 2014 and 2019, when it was still known as LTU Anime Con, and still works on Campus. He has been a fan of anime since the mid-90s, so that might date him a bit. During his limited time you can find him playing MineCraft and collecting anime enamel pins.
