description: Mars Ashton is an award-winning Indie Game Developer, Assistant Professor
  of Game Design at Lawrence Technological University, and a QA Tester for Finji.
  He explores social structures and human-centric narratives both within the play
  space of games and through the process of creating them. His work includes the topics
  of transhumanism, existentialism, and the often conflicting role of the self vs.
  the group that can be found throughout folklore and mythology.
