            <p class="color-white pb-3">Great Lakes Game Expo (GLGX) is an online game design and development expo organized by a <a class="color-orange" href="/organizers">group of coordinators</a> from midwest game communities. It strives to promote the work of our industry at all of its scales, highlighting the leaders and innovators as much as the hobbyists and tinkerers. Through talks and game showcases GLGX elevates the work of the midwest industry and provides new opportunities and outlets for disseminating the work of anyone working on games.</p>
