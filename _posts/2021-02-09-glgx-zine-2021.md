Wait, What the Heck is a Zine?
------------------------------
Great question! The Urban Diction defines a zine as "some sort of publication, usually mass-produced by photocopying (in some cases, scanned, put on the 'net, or copied via fax) on any range of topics, but usually filled with passion. a means of telling one's story, sharing thoughts, and/or artwork/comics/doodles". And in this case, it is chock full of gaming goodness! An interview! A guide! And even a game!? All this and more can be yours for the low, low price of clicking the link at the top of the page. Or, for maximum convenience, scroll down just a little further to read it online.
