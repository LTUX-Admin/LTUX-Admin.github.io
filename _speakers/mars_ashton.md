    Mars Ashton is an award-winning Indie Game Developer, Assistant Professor of Game Design at Lawrence Technological University, and a QA Tester for Finji. He explores social structures and human-centric narratives both within the play space of games and through the process of creating them. His work includes the topics of transhumanism, existentialism, and the often conflicting role of the self vs. the group that can be found throughout folklore and mythology.
    <br/><br/>As the Director of IGDA Detroit and co-founder of IGDA Ann Arbor, he is a core component of the Michigan game development community and has been able to utilize his vast network of students and professionals to provide the talent and support to help establish several local startups. As a frequent exhibitor and public speaker, Mars is always looking for new opportunities to share his work and learn from the work of others.
