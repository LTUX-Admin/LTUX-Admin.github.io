description: Inaugural Head Coach of the esports team at Lawrence Technological University.
  I have had a long history with video games and Iâ€™m excited that it is now a part
  of my career. I love fitness and am currently training for a half marathon and triathlon.
  I like a multitude of games and truly enjoy the multiplayer experience because it
  allows all types of people to come together to play. I hope to become a strong female
  role model in the gaming community one day and look forward to the future.
