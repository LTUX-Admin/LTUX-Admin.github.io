description:  A janitor (you) is cleaning Business Industries LLC's 
    office late at night. You start seeing things poof into existence 
    all around you. Sometimes it's good, like a brand new MopMaster 
    5000â„¢, and other times....well not so good. Trash bags, rotten food, 
    spilled slushies; you name it, if it's a mess, it's popped in. Clear 
    the mess before morning or else you'll be fired!
