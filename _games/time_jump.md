description:  The office is being Invaded again, time to do your 
    job and defend it. A physics-based stealth shooter set in an 
    office. Much like in real life, you will die in one hit from 
    these invaders so staying out of sight is imperative. Make your 
    way through your workspace in order to stay alive and to get 
    the help of a far more qualified person...
