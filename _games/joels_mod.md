description: The office is being Invaded again, time to do your 
    job and defend it. A physics-based stealth shooter set in an 
    office. Much like in real life, you will die in one hit from 
    these invaders so staying out of sight is imperative. Make 
    your way through your workspace in order to stay alive and to 
    get the help of a far more qualified person...
