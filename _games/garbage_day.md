description:  Buckle up! Garbage Day is a racing game at its core. 
    You'll be competing against up to four other players at collecting 
    the city's waste. Be careful though, other competitors can use any 
    means necessary to beat you to the trash. Collecting the trash 
    won't be enough, you'll only get credit for safely securing the 
    garbage into a local dumpster. Only the first collector to reach 
    the city's waste quota will be paid. Think you have what it takes 
    to be titled the 𝘛𝘙𝘈𝘚𝘏 𝘒𝘐𝘕𝘎!?!
